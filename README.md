# BUL-project
python code

2020 spring Boundary Layer seminar, Elizabeth Smith leads a project and an associated paper(Boundary layer meteorology) together with other students.

I made the cloud sensitivities experiment: using the RamanLidar to know the cloud base height and then devided the time investigated into: cloud free, cloudy and uncertain. 

Only focused on the cloud free and cloudy condition, evaluated the AERIonly AERIlidar and AERIDial performation under both conditions, compared the mean valued and carried out a t student test. The wvmr contains two point passed the 0.1 level siginificance and therefore showed siginificant differnt mean value of retrieval water vapor mixing ratio (wvmr) under the cloud free and cloudy condition.

First part of the code refered the bulk analysis with Brian Greene, and the cloud condition part has been done with Qingyu Wang. Package backed up on oscer.
